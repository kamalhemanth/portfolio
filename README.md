## Projects

### Covid-19 Analysis using Python and Tableau: 
[Source code](https://github.com/kamalhemanth/personal_projects/blob/main/covid19_analysis.py)

This COVID-19 Analysis project utilizes Python to examine and predict COVID-19 cases in India, focusing on data-driven insights. Using libraries like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations, and sklearn for building a linear regression model, the project offers a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic's progression across states.

#### Key Features:

- State-wise Analysis: Aggregate confirmed and death cases per state, highlighting the states with the highest numbers.
- Maharashtra Case Study: Analyze the trend in the rise of COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, one of the most affected states.
- Prediction Model: Build and train a linear regression model to predict future COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, using historical data.

- This project demonstrates skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, providing meaningful insights into COVID-19 trends in India.

### Real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV: 
[Source code](https://github.com/kamalhemanth/personal_projects/blob/main/Face_and_Eye_Detection.py)

The Real-Time Face and Eyes Detection project use OpenCV in Python to detect human faces and eyes from a webcam feed in real time. It employs Haar cascade classifiers for face and eye detection, highlighting the detected areas with rectangles.

#### Key Features:

- Face Detection: Detects and draws a rectangle around faces in real-time using the webcam feed.
- Eyes Detection: Identifies eyes within the detected face region, drawing rectangles around each eye.
- Real-Time Processing: The system operates in real-time, updating the video feed frame by frame for instant feedback.

- This project demonstrates proficiency in computer vision techniques and real-time image processing using OpenCV.

### Banking system Application Using Java:
[Source code](https://github.com/kamalhemanth/personal_projects/blob/main/Banking_System.java)

The Simple Banking System project is a console-based application built in Java that simulates basic banking operations. Users can create an account, make deposits, withdraw funds, and check their account balance in real time. This project demonstrates core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, encapsulation, and user interaction through the console.

#### Key Features:

- Account Creation: Users can create an account by entering their name and an initial deposit.
- Deposit & Withdrawal: The system allows users to deposit or withdraw money, with checks for valid transactions.
- Balance Check: Users can check their current balance at any time.

### Student Management System Using C
[Source code](https://github.com/kamalhemanth/personal_projects/blob/main/Student_management_system.c)

Student Management System is a console-based application built in C that allows users to manage student records efficiently. This system can store and retrieve essential student data such as roll numbers, names, and marks. It demonstrates basic C programming concepts like arrays, structures, and user interaction.

#### Key Features:

- Add Student Details: Users can input student information, including roll number, name, and marks.
- Display Student Details: View all stored student records in a list format.
- Update Student Details: Modify an existing student's information using their roll number.
- Delete Student Details: Remove a studentâ€™s record by roll number.

- This project is ideal for learning fundamental data management techniques and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in C
